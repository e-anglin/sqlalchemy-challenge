# sqlalchemy-challenge
This was a fun and challenging assignment. Designing the Flask API proved to be more difficult, as my environment variable had not been properly set up. Once I was able to pinpoint the problem, everything else started falling into place. I had assistance on this assignment from a tutor as well as one of my co-workers.
